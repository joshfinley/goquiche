Bake a Go program into a Gödel number quiche! 

---

Are you tired of reading Go code like a mere mortal? Do you wish your programs were more... numerical? Well, fork no more! Introducing Goquiche, the Go program that turns other Go programs into a single, massive, utterly useless number!

Features:
- Transforms beautiful, readable Go code into an incomprehensible integer
- Guaranteed to make your code reviews 1000% more confusing
- Perfect for when you want to say "I coded this" without actually showing any code
- Adds a delightful sprinkle of Gödel to your daily programming diet

Usage:
1. Feed it your Go code
2. Watch in awe as it spits out a number larger than your technical debt
3. Try (and fail) to recover your original code
4. Question your life choices

Remember, if anyone asks why you did this, just say it's for "advanced encryption purposes" and walk away dramatically.

Download now and turn your next project into a numerical nightmare! Because who needs readability when you can have a number so large it makes pi look like a rounding error?
